# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
First you nedd to install all dependacies :
```shell
npm install
```

You can launch the project locally by :
```shell
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/Deploy.js --network localhost
```
Then change :
<s>walletAddress</s> from App.js by the contract address in your terminal cmd.
